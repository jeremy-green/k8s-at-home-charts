## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

  helm repo add k8s-at-home https://jeremy-green.github.io/helm-charts

You can then run `helm search repo k8s-at-home` to see the charts.
